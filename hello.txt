Hello everyone. I am Haoran Zhang , an international student and have a major in data science in LSA. I am a sophomore and currently taking EECS 183 and EECS 203. Since I am transfer student that came from UCSB, I already complete some basic python courses in my pervious school but this is my first time to use external library in python to do data analysis. I am really excited to join data science club and hope everything is on the right track.Nice to meet you all!
